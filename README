Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RemovePrereqs::Provided

This module is a utility for people who are working with self-consuming
code ( predominantly "Dist::Zilla" distributions ) who wish to avoid
self-dependencies in cases where some other prerequisite providing tool
is over-zealous in determining prerequisites.

This is an initial implementation that assumes you have "[MetaProvides]"
of some description in place, and uses the data it provides to make sure
the same modules don't exist as prerequisites.
